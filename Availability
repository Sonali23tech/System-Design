Availability refers to the proportion of time a system is operational and accessible when required.
Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)

Availability is often expressed in "nines". The higher the availability, the less downtime there is.
Each additional "nine" represents an order of magnitude improvement in availability.

Example: 99.99% availability represents a 10-fold improvement in uptime compared to 99.9%.

Strategies for Improving Availability
1. Redundancy-Redundancy involves having backup components that can take over when primary components fail.
2. Load Balancing- Load balancing distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck, enhancing both performance and availability.
Techniques:
Hardware Load Balancers: Physical devices that distribute traffic based on pre-configured rules.

Software Load Balancers: Software solutions that manage traffic distribution, such as HAProxy, Nginx, or cloud-based solutions like AWS Elastic Load Balancer.

3. Failover Mechanisms- Failover mechanisms automatically switch to a redundant system when a failure is detected.
4. 4. Data Replication
5. Monitoring and Alerts
