Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of load by adding resources to the system.
A system that can continuously evolve to support a growing amount of work is scalable.
How can a System Grow?
1. Growth in User Base
2. Growth in Features
3. Growth in Data Volume
4. Growth in Complexity
5. Growth in Geographic Reach

How to Scale a System?

1.Vetical Scaling - when you increase the capacity of existing resource.
2. Horizontal Scaling - when we increase number of resources
3. Load Balancing
4. Caching
5. Content delivery network- CDN distributes static assets (images, videos, etc.) closer to users. This can reduce latency and result in faster load times.
6. Sharding/Partitioning
7. Asynchronous communication - Asynchronous communication means deferring long-running or non-critical tasks to background queues or message brokers.
8. Microservices Architecture
9. Auto-Scaling
10. Multi-region Deployment


Scaling means handling more request gracefully
- handle increased load
- not complex
- performance should not take a hit


If all this above points are checked , system is scalable.
