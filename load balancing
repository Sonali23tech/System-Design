Round Robin: Simple and even distribution, best for homogeneous servers.

Weighted Round Robin: Distributes based on server capacity, good for heterogeneous environments.

Least Connections: Dynamically balances based on load, ideal for varying workloads.

Least Response Time: Optimizes for fastest response, best for environments with varying server performance.

IP Hash: Ensures session persistence, useful for stateful applications.
