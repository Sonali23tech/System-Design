Replication means to have a copy
DB that has main data is primary db
and db that have copy is secondary.

Why we need replication?
- For mananging faults
- help to reduce latency  (by keeping copy near to your location) 
- primary data can be used for write and updates and secondary is used for reads only.

Replication lag - time it takes to copy update data from primary to secondary db

Complexity in replications
- when replication is huge , insconsitent data in secondary

How to solve this?
- Consistency Model
  - Read after write ( Replication lag is zero) , also called synchronous replication
All replicas have to be updated before host  aknowledged
  -   Asynchromous replication
Host is aknowledged after primary DB is updated.Replicas update asynchronously.

 - Semi- synchronous
Only one replica can acknowledge where primary db wait for only one replica achknowlegmenet.


Replica v/s snapshot
Snapshot is taking state of data t sepecific time.
