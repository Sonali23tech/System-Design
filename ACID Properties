What is a Database Transaction?
A transaction in the context of databases is a sequence of one or more operations (such as inserting, updating, or deleting records)
that the database treats as one single action. It either fully succeeds or fully fails, with no in-between states.

1. Atomicity
Atomicity ensures that a transaction—comprising multiple operations—executes as a single and indivisible unit of work: it either fully succeeds (commits) or fully fails (rolls back).

2.Consistency in the context of ACID transactions ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid state to another valid state—never leaving it in a broken or “invalid” state.

3.Isolation ensures that concurrently running transactions do not interfere with each other’s intermediate states.

Durability ensures that once a transaction has been committed, the changes it made will survive, even in the face of power failures, crashes, or other catastrophic events.
