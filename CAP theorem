Distributed System
- A system consisting of a group of machines working in coordination so as to appear as a single coherant system to the end-user.


 Consistency 
- Any read that is happening after a latest wite, all the nodes should return the latest value of that write

Availability
- Every available node in the system should respond in a non error format to any read request without guarantee of returning the latest write.

Partition tolerance
- System will be responding to all the read and write even if the comunication channel(or middleware) between nodes is broken( or partitioned).



What is the CAP Theorem
--  also known as brewer's theorem
--  any network shared system wants to have these three propoerties but you can have only 2 at time where partition tolerance is mandatory.


Degrees of consistency and avaiability
