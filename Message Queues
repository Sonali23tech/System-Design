- Sync v/s async communication
In sync communcation both the parties continuously exhanging information
In async communcation continuous exchange of information is not necessary

Message queue is used to accomplish async communication.
Message queues are a middleware used by different parts of a system( say producers and consumers) to  communicate or process operations asynchronously.

- SQS
- Kafka
- RabbitMQ

Producer- send mesages to queue
Consumer - consume messages from queue and do the processing

1. One to one(producer consumer model)
2. One to many( publisher subscriber model)
Amazon SQS used fifo ordered


Pub- sub messaging

Use case of pub sub
1. Async workflow
2. Decoupling
3. Load balancing
4. Deffered processing
5. Data streaming
