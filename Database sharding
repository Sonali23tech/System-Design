Partioning the dataset into different database


Vertical Partioning
- Pationing on the bases of column 


Horizontal Partioning
-Partioning on the bases of rows  and this is known as sharding



Logical sharding

Physical sharding

Advantages of sharding
- faster query , better performance
- we can place different shards on different location
- no single point of failure

Types of  sharding
- Alogthirm sharding - if app / client knows which shard to go to fetch data 
- Dynamic sharding  - if there is some other module which clients have to query to fetch data


Disadvantage of sharding
- choosing sharding key correctly matters
- once you have partioned the data  it is hard to rejoin the data
- all the database doesn't provide inbuilt sharding technologies
